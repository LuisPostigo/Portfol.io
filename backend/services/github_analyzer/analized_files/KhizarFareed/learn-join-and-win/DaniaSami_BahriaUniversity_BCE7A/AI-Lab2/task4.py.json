  "result": "This function, 'largest_and_smallest_difference' takes an array of numbers as an input and returns the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the array. It also includes error handling if the input array has less than 1 element.\n\nIn the provided Python code, the function 'largest_and_smallest_difference' is defined with the input parameter 'values'. It then uses Python's built-in 'min' and 'max' functions to find the smallest and largest values in the 'values' list, respectively. It calculates the difference between these values, and returns a string containing the smallest, largest, and difference values.\n\nThe 'numbers' list is defined with the values [5, 11, 8, 17, 25], and 'result' is assigned the result of calling 'largest_and_smallest_difference' on 'numbers'. Then, 'result' is printed to the console, which will display the return value of the function, which includes the smallest, largest, and difference values."
