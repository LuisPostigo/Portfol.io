  "result": "The code sums up all the digits and also finds the average of the digits in a string. \nThe solution uses Python's built-in string methods and basic arithmetic. The solution also handles cases where no digits are found in the string.\n\nThe function `sum_and_average_of_digits(input_string)` takes a string as input and returns a string that summarizes the sum and average of the digits in the string. If no digits are found in the string, the function returns a message saying so.\n\nThe function starts by initializing two variables, `digit_sum` and `digit_count`, to 0. It then iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is a digit, it adds the digit to `digit_sum` and increments `digit_count`. \n\nFinally, the function computes and returns the sum and average of the digits as a formatted string. If `digit_count` is 0 (indicating that no digits were found), the function returns a message saying so.\n\nThe string \"E-303 is at 2 th floor of"
