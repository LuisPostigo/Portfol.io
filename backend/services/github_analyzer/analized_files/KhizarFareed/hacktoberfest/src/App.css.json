It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) and error handling mechanisms.\n\nThe code also uses SQL for data retrieval and manipulation, and regex for pattern matching.\n\nIn terms of HTML (the markup language that the code uses), it's used to structure the content on the page, but it's not dynamically executed.\n\nThe code also uses a lot of CSS for styling and animation.\n\nThe code is also using a lot of HTML and CSS techniques such as flexbox and grid layout to create responsive designs.\n\nFinally, the code uses a lot of JavaScript for interactive elements and effects.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the code does seem to be in Python, the language itself might not be considered \"Object-Oriented Programming\" (OOP) because Python is a procedural language and doesn't explicitly use classes or objects. However, Python does have several ways to achieve similar results, such as using classes or objects.\n\nThe provided code is an example of a simple web page layout in HTML. It uses the `.App` class to style the whole page, `"
