Randomization is used effectively to pick cheers, and time control (via `sleep`) adds dramatic effect. Functions are well-structured and clearly separate responsibilities. A countdown loop demonstrates basic iteration, and although there is no direct user input, the script engages the user through printed messages. Overall, the script is fun, readable, and a great example of beginner-friendly Python programming with Auburn flair!"
